## Introduction

From foods to apparel, décor to makeup, electronics to technology, there has been a constant conflict between the words ‘trend’ and ‘sustainable’, and during this continuous fight, trend has always been ahead.

## Trend vs Sustainable

The term ‘trend’ promotes style, glamour, modernized and artificial, neglecting the
sustainability, and its pros and cons. On the other hand, ‘sustainable’ promotes long-lasting,
natural, eco-friendly, and extended benefits.

In the recent century when the sustainable was considered mostly outdated, short-lived style has led to devastating effects on humans. However, with progress in awareness and knowledge, the world is shifting towards the products that implement friendly footprints to the mother earth and whose impacts will benefit the ecosystem for
an infinite period.

## Slow Fashion

In the world of fashion, we encounter two similar rivals as sustainable fashion vs fast fashion.
The craze of young generation to walk along the revolutionizing fashion trends has paved way for cheaper, low quality, short-lived but stylish products piling up waste for decades. On the other hand, the sustainable fashion has been emerging as the new direction of apparel industry and is also termed as slow fashion.

### Why sustainable is called slow fashion?

Sustainable is called slow fashion because, it is:

-   Long Lasting
-   Ethical
-   Eco-friendly

Long lasting fashion refers to the consumptions of clothes with extended life cycles whereas eco-friendly fashion promotes the reuse of second-hand items, properly disposing of their items or through donation, fabric reuse and repair.

## What is Ethical Fashion?

Ethical fashion has been defined as, fashionable clothes that incorporate fair trade principles with sweatshop-free labor conditions while not harming the environment or workers by using biodegradable and organic cotton.

### Ethical Fashion and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)

One of the main issues in ethical fashion is how humans and the environment interact. The
preference for ethical products among consumers today, who not only seek high-quality items but are also concerned with sustainability and corporate social responsibility, is what motivates businesses to use ethical business practices. Sustainability and moral behavior have recently become important in the world of clothing. People are starting to understand that changing consumption patterns successfully depends on consumers' choices, actions, and manner of life in addition to the availability of products on the market.

## Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)

The TBP is one of the most influential models employed by several studies regarding sustainable consumption, such as green purchase behaviors, visiting environmental restaurant and hotels, adopting hybrid electric vehicles and consumption of organic food.

The TPB suggests that attitudes, subjective norm and PBC are three principal factors that
determine behavioral intention, which leads to actual behavior.

-   According to Ajzen, a person's attitude towards a particular behavior is determined by
    how favorably they judge the behavior in question. A person may have a positive attitude
    towards a behavior if they think it will lead to a positive outcome, and the opposite is also true. A favorable correlation between attitude and behavioral intention has been found to exist across numerous cultural contexts when it comes to ethical fashion.
-   The subjective norm is defined as “perceived social pressure to perform or not perform a
    behavior”. It refers to the perceived social pressure from important reference group (e.g.
    family members, close friends and colleagues) to a particular behavior, and whether or
    not an individual will consider the pressure when deciding to act the behavior. In the
    context of fashion, the pressure toward ethical conducts of fashion brands are dominant; the pressure would not only affect companies to address the societal impacts of their operations but also affects consumers to be in
    line with the sustainable behavior.
    When consumers perceive that significant others endorse ethical fashion, they are more
    prone to adopt these behaviors.
-   Finally, PCB is an individual's perception about whether performing a certain behavior is
    easy or difficult. PCB depends on past experience and anticipated obstacles. Many
    studies have shown that PBC is positively related to intention in various sustainable
    activities, such as visiting green hotels and organic food consumption.

### Trust in the Fashion Industry and TPB

There are five barriers for sustainable consumption, namely

1. Lack of awareness
2. Negative perceptions
3. Distrust
4. High prices
5. Low availability

### KAB, Trust and TPB

The KAB (Knowledge-Attitude-Behavior) model has been proposed as a way to explain the role of knowledge, in which the behavior changes gradually. It has been used in academic research in the fields of information security, health, the environment, education, clinical service areas, and, sporadically, ethics, leading to behavioral change over time. Researchers have demonstrated that, although it is not the only reason, a gain in knowledge can result in a change in behavior.

## Conclusion

Ethical and sustainable fashion is not just an industry, it is an ideology that promotes humanity and welfare to its ecosystem. But none is possible without consciousness of our acts, our lifestyles and everyday practices.
