Today, the world of fabrics offers a vast array of choices and qualities. But have you ever wondered where these fascinating properties come from? Textiles undergo various chemical treatments during processing, classified broadly into three stages: pre-treatment, dyeing or coloration, and finishing. These wet processes consume significant amounts of water, energy, and chemicals.

## Pre-treatment

Pre-treatment is a crucial, first step in the fabric processing journey. Its purpose is to remove impurities like oil and dirt, while enhancing the fabric's brightness and texture. By doing so, it paves the way for efficient dyeing and finishing applications. Common treatments include
scouring, desizing, and bleaching.

## Coloration

Coloration breathes life into fabrics. Synthetic dyes play a significant role in this stage, offering a wide range of long-lasting, vibrant shades at lower production costs. Different types of synthetic dyes, such as disperse dyes, vat dyes, and reactive dyes, are chosen based on the fabric type and desired quality.

## Functional Finishes

Functional finishes add the magic touch to fabrics, imbuing them with desirable characteristics. From stain resistance to antimicrobial properties, these finishes enhance the fabric's functionality.

For instance, Durable Water and Oil Repellency (DWOR) finishes prevent water and oil from spreading on fabric surfaces. Antimicrobial finishes are gaining popularity in the healthcare and active wear settings, for providing odor resistance and maintaining hygiene.

## Negative Impacts of Textile Dyeing and Finishing

While the dyeing and finishing industries play a significant role in textile manufacturing processes, they are among the prime causes of environmental pollution and excessive consumption of resources (water, energy, and chemicals). Synthetic dyes, despite their appeal, are not only toxic to the environment, particularly the untreated wastewater, but also pose significant health risks to humans. Dyeing one ton of fabric
requires an astounding 200 tons of water. Prolonged exposure to heavy metals present in some dyes has been linked to birth defects, brain damage, and kidney damage, posing grave risks to human health.

Chemicals like PFCs used in textile treatments are virtually indestructible and linked to kidney cancer and reproductive toxicity. Similarly, traditional antimicrobial finishes containing heavy metals like zinc, silver, and copper can leach into soil and water, thus contaminating them.
Besides, there have been concerns about the potential adverse effects of these finishes on human skin, with the full extent of their impact largely unknown.

To regulate the use of such toxic chemicals in textile manufacturing, importing nations have established guidelines that require certification or labels from internationally recognized organizations like Oeko-Tex® , as part of the contentious [non-tariff measures](/blog/the-impact-of-free-trade-agreements-on-textile-production-regulations).

## Innovative Approaches for Recycling Textiles Contaminated with Dyes and Other Chemicals

Recycling textiles presents a complex challenge that involves the identification and separation of fiber blends, dyes, finishes, and other additives used in processing treatments. As different fibers have distinct physical properties and bonding affinities to dyes, achieving pure fiber necessitates careful separation. Understanding the type and mode of dyeing becomes essential to obtain purer and higher-quality recycled fabric.

Fortunately, various innovative approaches have emerged to address the recycling of textiles contaminated with chemical additives, targeting different aspects of the process. Some techniques focus on the removal of chemical impurities, while others aim to recycle the dyes themselves, collectively falling under the umbrella of chemical recycling.

## Worn Again’s Sustainable Fiber Regeneration

In collaboration with H&M and Kering, [Worn Again](https://greenblueorg.s3.amazonaws.com/smm/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Worn-Again.pdf) has developed an innovative process to recycle textile waste consisting of pure PET or blends of PET-cotton/cellulose. The primary end products are 100% PET resin chips and cellulosic pulp that can be regenerated into polyester and cellulose fibers, respectively.

During the dissolution step, a solvent dissolves the PET component, removing dyes and other organic impurities bound to it. Chemicals are also used to separate dyes from cellulosic fibers. What sets this process apart is its exceptional energy efficiency. The added solvent dissolves polyester, while insoluble impurities are filtered out. By removing the solvent, the purified polyester can be regenerated. Since polyester remains chemically intact (as a polymer), surplus energy required for reduction to monomeric units and subsequent repolymerisation is preserved.

## Sustainable Textile Prints with Vividye

Additionally, a Swedish start-up named [Vividye](https://www.vividye.com/technology) introduced a sustainable solution for textile prints. Utilizing surface chemistry, their reversible coloring technology allows the application and removal of textile prints without damaging the fibers. This versatile technology can be easily applied to both organic and synthetic fibers, promoting reuse and recycling while extending the lifespan of textiles and conserving resources. What's more, the technology seamlessly integrates into existing infrastructure, eliminating the need for expensive and resource-intensive new setups.

## DyeRecycle’s Vision for Circular Fabric Dyeing

Another initiative, [DyeRecycle](https://www.dyerecycle.com/), presents a sustainable fiber-dying technology that supports independent recycling of both fibers and dyes. This groundbreaking process involves the selective extraction of dyes from textile waste using a liquid solvent/medium. Ensuring circularity in all aspects, the recovered dye can be reused to color new fabric, the decolorized fiber/fabric can be reused or recycled, and the medium for dye extraction itself is recycled and reused. DyeRecycle not only promotes fiber circularity but also embraces sustainable green chemistry practices.

## Create Sustainable Pigment Dyes with Recycrom

[Recycrom](https://recycrom.com/), an innovative venture by Officinia 39+, offers a transformative production process that turns textile waste into finely powdered pigment dye. This unique dye can be used to color fabrics and apparel made of cotton, wool, nylon, or other natural fibers or blends. The raw materials for Recycrom can range from fibers and textile scraps to recycled clothing. Unlike traditional dyes that are used as chemical solutions, Recycrom is applied in the form of a suspension, significantly reducing its environmental footprint. The versatility of Recycrom allows for various application methods, such as screen printing, spraying, and coating. Collaborating brands have the luxury to create custom Recycrom dyes from their own fabric scraps and textile waste, promoting sustainable coloration practices.

## Circularizing Denim

The popularity of denim spans generations, but the disposal of used denim in landfills and the dye run-off from denim production have adverse environmental consequences. To address this, a team from Deakin University developed the concept of '[circular denim](https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/news-and-media-releases/articles/denim-goes-green-thanks-to-deakin-innovation)'. This innovative approach pulverizes old denim into ultra-fine color particles that can be coated or printed onto new, undyed denim, achieving the iconic appearance. The color of these particles can be enhanced or modified before application, significantly conserving resources when compared to traditional denim production and recycling methods.

## Challenges for Successful Integration of Innovative Practices

Technological advancements in textile recycling have been plentiful and continue to progress rapidly. However, several factors impede the integration of these developments into mainstream recycling processes.

-   Chemical recycling facilities, while being promising, can be more energy and capital-intensive than mechanical recycling facilities.
-   As such facilities are usually designed at a larger scale, a consistent supply of extensive bulks of feedstock material is crucial for the facility to be profitable.
-   Infrastructure for the collection of textile waste is lacking when compared to that of PET packaging (plastic bottles and containers).
-   Additionally, governmental policies and regulations that offer market incentives for the collection and recycling of textile waste are currently limited.

## Conclusion

In the fashion industry’s quest for sustainability amid growing environmental concerns, innovative recycling methods like Recycrom emerge as vital allies. These pioneering ventures offer promising alternatives, reducing the environmental footprint and conserving resources. Though the challenges in integrating these advancements into mainstream recycling persist, embracing these innovations can pave the way to a future of more sustainable fashion.
