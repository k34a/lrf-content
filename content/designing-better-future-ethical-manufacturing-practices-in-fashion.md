The Fashion Industry around the world has many social and environmental impacts. Excessive use of resources, waste generation, rapid production methods, and contamination of the environment are negative impacts of the fashion industry. Now, more people are aware of these impacts, which has led to the formation of a new marketplace called "Ethical Fashion." This article delves into the heart of this ethical fashion, examining how ethical manufacturing practices are changing the fashion landscape.

## The Rise of Ethical Fashion and Growing Communities in Africa

A wave of ethical fashion is moving across the subcontinent in Africa. They are now looking for options that align with their values, paving the way for brands to adopt more responsible production methods. They are more focused on their rich traditional artisanal skills and sustainable practices. In Ghana, Kenya, and many other African countries, small industries are setting up themselves and producing garments from locally sourced raw materials. Our organization is one of them. They use low-impact dyes and natural fibres. In this way, they polish their skills and empower local artist communities.

## Ethical Manufacturing Practices: Not Just a Trend but Necessity

### Fair Trade Practices

First, we have to know about "Fair trade". It is a global movement that helps producers and manufacturers in growing countries access extra favorable alternate agreements. The main objectives of this movement are for workers to get fair wages and better working conditions. In Africa, people form cooperative groups and they discuss and decide the price of handmade products by local artisans. The goal of this kind of cooperative is to ensure that these artists are paid fairly for their work. This whole teamwork makes workers more confident in their work.

### Offering Capacity Development

Capacity building is a bedrock of the fashion industry shifting towards more ethical and sustainable practices. It includes upgrading the knowledge and skills and enhancing the capabilities of individuals by training them with new skills. Home-based labor, new employees, and management staff participate in training programs to better understand working processes and new techniques. Moreover, companies also sponsor some training programs that help improve their technical skills, the quality of their work, and leadership. Training programs in capacity building focus on sustainable and environmentally friendly production methods. It includes educating the stakeholders on using organic raw materials, responsible manufacturing processes (with low-impact dyes and natural fibres, less use of harsh chemicals, etc.), and ways to reduce waste.

### Creating Opportunities for the Local Producers

It involves helping small-scale producers and manufacturers to be independent and self-sufficient. Provide resources like raw materials, small machinery, product designs, and other things that equip them to run their business. Also, provide them training to get better work experience. Companies work with local communities to encourage them. Acknowledge and nurture their work and commit to purchasing their products at fair prices to improve their economic situation.

### Transparency and Accountability

This practice highlights the trust among manufacturers, stakeholders, buyers, and consumers. It requires being transparent in all aspects of the work and disclosing all the information about raw materials, chemicals, dyes, and the product's overall impact. Moreover, companies keep records of everything, like employee training, courses to learn new techniques and other facilities given to workers. They do this by writing down everything and keep as proof.

### Providing Fair Payment

Ethical manufacturing practice includes payment of fair wages to the workers for their services and products. This wage should cover food, water, and other expenses. Companies should provide raw materials, product design, and damage to purchase machinery for local or home-based producers to boost their business.

### Ensuring No Child Labor

It is an ethical practice to ensure that children do not work in industry. It means that companies and businesses are taking steps to ensure that child labor should not be exploited. It is important because children have the right to go to school, play, and be safe, not work. Companies that follow this ethical practice are committed to providing a work environment that respects the welfare and rights of children.

### Good Working Condition

Every workplace must provide a safe and healthy working environment for employees. They should be well aware of their health and safety requirements. Working conditions matter a lot while shifting towards sustainable practices. It includes reasonable working hours, respect for workers' rights, and care for their health and wellness.

### Equality in Workspace

Companies should not discriminate against their workers for race, religion, or gender. Gender, racial, and religious equality play a central role in ethical practices in a variety of settings, including the workplace, society, and other community interactions. Ensuring that every person gets equal opportunities, is paid fair wages, and has their perspectives respected highlights equality in all senses to promote ethical manufacturing practices.
