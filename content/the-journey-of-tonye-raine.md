## About

Tonye's exposure to clothing, fashion, and to some extent, sustainability, dates back to her childhood. She grew up in rural Nigeria with her five siblings under the care of their mother, who was a seamstress. Her mother learned the craft from Ibadan, studying under one of the region's finest tailors. With her remarkable fashion designs, she established a loyal clientele, attracting even more customers from far and wide with her ability to
create both traditional and western clothing.

## Tonye’s Upbringing

During her upbringing, Tonye developed a deep and affectionate bond with her mother, longing to spend as much time with her as possible. She would eagerly sit beside her mother and observe the magical transformation of exceptional designs into elegant dresses. In those enchanting moments, amidst the rhythmic tapping of the pedal and the gentle hum of the loom, Tonye found a sense of calmness and comfort, igniting her passion for fashion.

Tonye's mother strongly believed in the power of education and dedicated much of her earnings to educate her children and meet their basic needs, leaving little, if any, for new clothes. As a result, their clothing was often sewn from leftover fabric. Tonye fondly recalls her special school bag from her primary school days, which was made from a rice sack—a testament to her mother's creativity and resourcefulness.

When the family relocated to Lagos, their circumstances slightly improved. Tonye would transform donated clothing into unique dresses, bags, and accessories, showcasing her ingenuity and inspiring others to contribute to her projects. Her frugal and judicious use of fabrics ensured that no scrap went to waste.

Although there was a delay in her academic pursuits, Tonye eventually obtained a degree in English and Literary Studies from the University of Nigeria Nsukka. While she would have loved to pursue another degree in fashion
at a prestigious university, financial constraints have hindered her from doing so.

## Her Work

Tonye's passion for fashion design led her to undertake an apprenticeship at a reputable fashion house. Working alongside experienced tailors and beaders, she witnessed firsthand the excessive fabric waste. Her lifelong commitment to using fabrics consciously fueled her determination to find sustainable solutions to this problem.

The textile and apparel industry plays a vital role in the economy of developing countries, providing employment opportunities and driving exports. However, it is also notorious for its negative environmental impact. Committed to promoting sustainability and finding practical solutions to reduce waste in the sector, Tonye embraced
the challenge of upcycling old clothing and fabric scraps. Inspired by LRF's vision of sustainable fashion, she has joined forces with the [Larry Rowbs Foundation](https://larryrowbsfoundation.org/) (LRF) to create a sustainable fashion industry and contribute to a greener earth.

For far too long, individuals like [Tonye Raine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonye-raine-489b6584/) have been ignored by the world. How much longer will we overlook the remarkable skills of those working tirelessly to rebuild the fashion industry and make it more eco-friendly, simply because we can't profit from them? These are the kind of people the Larry Rowbs Foundation aims to bring into the spotlight. We cannot achieve this alone, but
together, by supporting the Larry Rowbs clothing recycling initiative, we can reduce environmental pollution caused by textile waste, establish a good and organized standard in the fashion industry, and ultimately empower
and give a voice to incredible individuals like Tonye.
