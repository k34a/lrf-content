## Introduction

What happens to a t-shirt you have worn for the past three years and are now bored of? You donate it.

Many countries like the USA, China, Canada, and the UK donate such used clothes to developing countries like Uganda, Burundi, Madagascar, and other African Countries. Although the intention for this donation is benevolent, sadly, this has not made these African countries any better.

Approximately 70% of the donations are not fit for reusing or reselling. Either they are dirty or damaged. Thus, this entire unfit lot is disposed to landfills in these African countries. This means that the developed nations are indirectly dumping their textile waste into these underdeveloped countries, unintentionally or maybe intentionally: who knows?

Instead of ranting about this, we need to propose new solutions. The Larry Rowbs Foundation is taking up the task of scouting this unusable clothing waste that comes from developed countries. We will be recycling this waste into ultra-durable and super-fashionable apparel.

## We can Recycle these clothes!

Larry Rowbs Foundation will be setting up a recycling facility in Uganda. This facility will transform this old and unusable clothing into something strong and fashionable. This facility will thus help revert the harmful effects of fast fashion – on the environment and the community.

Moreover, the revenue generated from sales of these recycled items will be used to set up an educational institute. This institute will teach people about fashion. It will help people understand that sustainability and fashion can go hand in hand.

Just imagine how much this will help African countries!

1. Textile waste will no longer contribute to increasing the size of **landfills** in these countries.
2. The world is moving away from fast fashion. Instead, people are demanding recycled and more sustainable clothes. Once Larry Rowbs Foundation starts manufacturing recycled apparel, African **economies** will be boosted. This will, in turn, create more jobs and opportunities for people.
3. Research and Development will be promoted around the sustainable textile industry. The Larry Rowbs Foundation envisions creating a **school** to teach people about sustainability and fashion – all for **free**.

## The process to Recycle Old Clothes

A question will pop into our minds: How can clothes be recycled? Indeed, they can be! Here is how. We are in a process of setting up the recycling unit. In this unit, we plan the following steps to transform old clothes into something useful and more fashionable. Please note that this is a plan that the foundation has put forward.

1. **Segregation**: Once we have collected the unusable clothes, segregation starts. Our team divides them into cotton, polyester, polycotton, and other categories. This ensures purity in the final product.
2. **Washing**: The team then washes these clothes to remove all dirt. Clothing from each category is passed through several washing cycles to stop any impurities from getting into the product’s fabric.
3. **Fabric Shredding**: After segregation and cleaning, we pass the fabric through a shredding machine to break it into smaller, reusable pieces.
4. **Fiber Opening and Cleaning**: The volunteers pass the fabric through a fiber-opening machine. This machine separates the shredded material into threads, which are further cleaned with the help of a fiber-cleaning machine.
5. **Processing**: Bale press is then used to recast the threaded material into bales. Once we get the bales, yarn-spinning will convert them into fashionable products.
