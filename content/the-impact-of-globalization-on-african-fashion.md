## Globalization’s Impact on the Diversity of African Fashion

Globalization has a significant impact on the African fashion industry, both positive and negative. It has exposed African fashion to the world. Just because of social media, the work of African designers is more accessible to people outside the continent. Now people from other parts of the world can communicate and start trading raw materials for the clothing industry. The best thing is that Africa is capable of manufacturing its raw material from scratch by recycling and upcycling. Increased awareness of Africa's rich and diverse cultural heritage has resulted in a higher demand for African fashion from people around the world. African fashion has been able to integrate traditional and modern styles, creating a unique fashion sense that is now being embraced globally. The fusion of traditional African prints, fabrics, and patterns with contemporary styles has become popular in the fashion industry. Due to the internet and social media exposure, people are now showing interest in buying African prints. Technically, fashion comprises all kinds of clothing items, fabrics, and trends. Now fashion designers are expanding their umbrella to the world.

The globalization of fashion has led to the adoption of Western styles, which has led to a decline in the use of traditional African fabrics and patterns. This has led to concerns about the erosion of traditional African culture. It has brought with it issues of intellectual property rights. The appropriation of African designs by Western designers and companies without proper attribution or compensation has been a concern for many African designers.

### Impact of Globalization on Ghanaian Fashion

The history of Ghanaian fashion is traced back to the pre-colonial era when indigenous Ghanaians used bark of trees and the hides of animals to clothe themselves (Adu-Akwaboa, 1994). The development of fashion in Ghana is believed to have started during the colonial period with the introduction of wax prints and "dress" by the colonial masters (Turnings, 2002) But today, Ghanaian fashion has changed due to globalization. Now designers are styling clothes inspired by the Western world. This interconnectedness of styles has influenced the young generation of Africa to wear modern clothes that they see wearing their favorite social media stars. Ghana's income generated from the fashion industry is comparatively low. The government has taken many steps for the development of the industrial sector.  
Fashion education is now a part of their education. Traditional clothing plays a significant role in Ghanaian fashion and culture. While globalization has brought Western styles and fabrics to Ghana, many Ghanaians still prefer to wear traditional clothing made from sturdy fabrics that are rich in color and detail. Kente, a hand-woven cloth made from silk and cotton, is one of the most popular forms of traditional clothing in Ghana. It is often worn on special occasions such as weddings, funerals, and festivals. Kaba and slits are also popular among women in Ghana. This traditional outfit has a long wrap skirt (the Slit) and a matching top (the Kaba). The Kaba and Slit are often made from bright, bold fabrics with intricate patterns and details. For men, the smock is a popular form of traditional clothing in Ghana. It is a loose-fitting top that is often made from hand-woven cotton or silk, and it is usually designed with traditional symbols and patterns.
Overall, traditional clothing is an integral part of Ghanaian fashion and culture, and it continues to be worn and celebrated by Ghanaians both in Ghana and around the world. While globalization has brought new styles and fabrics to Ghana, traditional clothing remains an integral part of Ghanaian identity and heritage.

### Impact of Foreign Brands

Local fashion designers in Ghana are creatively blending African fabrics into Western styles, making the clothes more appealing to a broader international audience. While some Ghanaian clothing designs may be Western-inspired, they are often translated into vibrant African prints, giving them a unique and distinctive look.

Ghanaian fashion designers have made a significant impact on the global fashion industry, with many renowned brands emerging from the country. These designers have earned international recognition for their creativity, innovation, and ability to combine traditional African fabrics with modern styles. Examples of such brands include April Rust, Atto Tetteh, Denkyi, Duaba Serwa, Citizins, and Virgil Abloh.

## Summary

While globalization has brought many benefits, it has also been associated with negative consequences, such as
increased inequality, environmental degradation, and cultural homogenization. It has been the subject of debate and controversy, with some arguing that it has created winners and losers, and others arguing that it has the potential to benefit everyone if managed properly. Now people from other parts of the world are well aware of African fashion and the fusion of different concepts of fashion is now becoming a trend among youngsters.
