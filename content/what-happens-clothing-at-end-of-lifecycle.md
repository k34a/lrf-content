## Introduction

We all know that everything has a lifecycle: things are made, utilized, and disposed of. It is the
journey of a piece of cloth, manufactured through many stages, worn, and then discarded. So,
what happens when an individual no longer wants to wear a particular garment?

## The Fate of Clothing: What Happens When Its Lifecycle Comes to an End?

### Reuse

When clothing reaches the end of its lifecycle, we can donate gently worn clothes to charity
organizations or thrift stores so that others can benefit from them.

Reusing works for companies that offer take-back programs to recycle those clothes to make new
ones. Brands like Lean Closet by Cuyana, Thred Up, Eileen Fisher Renew, Vestaire Collective,
Worn Wear by Patagonia, Thrilling, etc., are reusing and reselling pre-loved garments. The
Rowbs Foundation follows the tack-back program for reuse purposes.

### Repurpose

Transforming old clothes into something new or creative can extend their life. For example, a t-
shirt can transform into a cleaning rug. We can create cushion covers from our old funky jackets.
We use DIY techniques to transform old clothes into fresh and fashionable pieces.

Companies that specialize in doing upcycling call it reworked fashion. It involves reshaping,
restructuring, and re-stitching the garments or sections from old clothes, merging elements like
off-cuts, vintage textiles, and trims. By transforming discarded pieces into unique creations,
reworked clothing breathes new life into fashion while reducing waste.

### Recycling

Old clothes are used as raw materials to manufacture others. Now, textiles are more focused on
recycling procedures to make new ones. It reduces waste and the cost of raw materials. Garments
are sorted, shredded, and turned into raw materials for various purposes. Brands like Girlfriend
Collective, Topiku, Organic Basics, Tentree, Ecoalf, and Aya Labels produce recycled products.

Our main objective is to lessen the dumpsites. Fewer dumpsites mean less pollution. So, we take
a step to use the dumpsite or landfills to extract the raw material and create innovative and
fashionable products. It will lead to a reduction in the landfill buildup.

Clothing that cannot be reused, recycled, or repurposed will utilized as alternative fuel sources.
In this process, textiles incinerate to produce energy that can be used to enlighten our homes,
offices, or other industrial facilities. In Europe, 5.6% of total waste is incinerated and converted
into energy. It does not support sustainability, though. So, we can recover some value from those
unwanted clothes that would otherwise become waste.

### Landfills

At last, clothes that do not biodegrade or are inapt for other purposes may end up in landfills or
burnt on open fires. These clothes decompose and emit greenhouse gases, which are the source
of global warming.

The [Larry Rowbs Foundation](/) is working hard to take advantage of these landfills as they recycle
those unwanted clothes and make reusable, multipurpose clothes and shoes.

## Conclusion

In short, when the lifecycle of clothing ends, it can be reused, repurposed, or recycled. Clothes
from landfills can be used as raw material to manufacture new ones. We can reduce the negative
effect of textile procedures on our environment by following those practices. Here is some
advice if you want to say goodbye to your old clothes: consider the adverse effects of wasting
clothes and make thoughtful decisions to contribute to sustainability.

The Rowbs Recycling Project aims to provide fully recycled, sustainable products such as
clothes and shoes for men and women. Their products are multipurpose and long-lasting, unlike
fast fashion products. This Uganda-based organization is utilizing its energy to produce
fashionable and unique products. Despite the challenges and risks, they encourage sustainable
practices in their manufacturing process.
