## Role of Technology and its Importance in Clothing Production

Technology has consistently shown to be the most helpful tool for nearly every company to advance. In addition to assisting organizations in progress, upgrades also make operations easier for both staff members and individuals in general. This emphasizes how crucial technology is in creating advancements and that it has a broad positive impact. The global financial system and civilization rely on the textile and apparel industries. In order to provide access to data associated with customer requests, industry products, and raw materials, a global economy needs cost-effective processes. The future of the global apparel manufacturing industry is presently being shaped by a significant global influence. The potential for growth is tremendous, as it is with any transformational impact, but there are also many obstacles to overcome. In today's temporary fashion clothing, where trends in fashion and consumer requirements shift instantly, adaptability and flexibility are essential qualities. Additionally, the physical isolation of the manufacturing and supplying contributors, as well as the effective information-sharing mechanisms among the business partners along global supply chain operations, add another level of complication to the contemporary apparel producing network. In this manner, secure information systems design is needed for the storing, sharing, and processing of data related to the apparel supply network. Data from the supply chain for the apparel industry could be analyzed to identify problem areas so that the logistics controlling management teams could issue the appropriate operational directions.

## What is the 4.0 Industrial Revolution?

In recent years, various techniques for keeping an eye on the procedures and actions in the connected industry have been developed. Industry 4.0 is what this is, and it has caused virtualization of the processes, where supply networks allow all the engaged parties, real-time access to pertinent products and manufacturing information.

In contrast to its physical domain, which involves autonomous robots and additive manufacturing, its fundamental ideas are related to the virtual realm and include the **Internet of Things** (IoT), Cloud Computing, Big Data, etc. Regarding cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things (IoT) is defined as the idea of collecting data from real-world items employing computer networks or fast wireless networks. There is a significant quantity of statistical data to be exchanged and assessed that is derived from the information from the products, machines, or production lines. Design archives, client orders, supplier deliveries, stock, and logistics-related data are additional sources of data. This vast amount of data is overall referred to as "**Big Data**", which is another key idea in Industry 4.0. Furthermore, among the most important concepts in the virtual industrial world is **cloud computing**, which is concerned with processing all of the accessible information. All of these cyber technologies contribute to ensuring the effective application of current data for later smart production.

## Development of Additive Manufacturing (AM)

The physical aspect of smart factories, however, is constrained by the capabilities of the current production systems. As a result, AM becomes one of the key elements of Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 requires large-scale customization, so unconventional manufacturing techniques must be created. Due to its capability to produce complicated items with advanced attributes (new materials, shapes), AM may, therefore, turn into a crucial technology for fabricating customized goods. AM is now being employed in several sectors, including manufacturing, aircraft, and biomedicine, as a result of improved product quality. Although there remain some questions regarding its suitability for mass production, the industry is increasingly using additive manufacturing (AM) as a result of recent technical developments. In the coming years, this emerging technology may provide an alternative to current manufacturing processes by producing accurate, reinforced complex items more quickly.

## Nanotechnology and Smart Textiles

Smart fabrics," which are produced by fusing intelligent nanoparticles with more traditional materials, have recently come into the spotlight. Smart textiles are those that can react to environmental changes by changing one or more of their properties to carry out a purpose. In the process of developing smart textiles, three generations have occurred. The very first generation of smart textiles, often known as "**passive**" textiles, may detect changes in their environment but are unable to modify their features. For instance, textiles coated with different metal oxide nanoparticles can provide clothing that is IR/UV resistant, and cotton that has been treated with silver nanoparticles has anti-microbial qualities. The second-generation, or "**active**" smart textiles are made of materials that first detect environmental changes or stimuli and then react appropriately. Examples comprise textiles with shape memory that can react to mechanical anomalies and thermochromic fabrics that change color in response to temperature shifts. Active textiles of the third generation, also known as "**super-smart**" textiles, are combined with smart and soft electronics that include sensors, optical devices, nano-generators, and energy storage systems. For instance, on-body electronics can provide sensing for different illnesses, dangers, or contaminants. Furthermore, nano-generators and energy storage systems can enable eye-catching optical components on smart textiles.

The ability to combine microelectronic devices with textiles has advanced to the point where it is possible to take advantage of the special characteristics of nanomaterials to give fabrics and clothing a high added-value functionality while still maintaining other desired qualities like aesthetic appeal, lightness, flexibility, and comfort.

### Traceability through Cyber Management or Block Chain Technology

Organizational structures are changing as a result of the increased demand for customized individual goods and shortening product life cycles. In this setting, distributed systems are capable of managing extremely complicated issues and assisting in self-regulating systems, also referred to as cybernetic management. With transparency, traceability increases sales while ensuring product safety and quality. There are several plans in place right now to make traceability a trustworthy and competitive feature for customers. Products can be tracked individually all across the supply chain using wireless sensors, DNA markers, secure tags, Near Field Communication (NFC), Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID), or Electronic Product Codes (EPC).

## Conclusion

In a nutshell, employing the most recent technologies in fashion will prove as a new paradigm for the textile industry. An insight into the current trends of using additive manufacturing and nanotechnology in the modern textile industries inspires and anticipates further research in this field, the while blockchain technology will assure the value of final products.
