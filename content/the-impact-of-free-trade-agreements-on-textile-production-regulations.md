Free trade agreements have sparked debate in the past. From NAFTA to Brexit, FTAs have been accused of creating imbalance and unfairness. Yet, policymakers promote and defend this approach to global trade. Why? Join me as I attempt to understand FTAs and their impact, particularly, on textile production regulations.

## Introduction

Textile production involves a series of processes including thread making, knitting, dying, and more. A value chain refers to the various stages involved in production, in addition to pre- and post-production processes. With the rise of globalization, each fragment of the value chain is distributed across several countries, giving rise to global value chains (GVCs). GVCs have significant implications for trade and economic development. To ensure the smooth operation of GVCs many economists advocate for a liberalized approach to trade.

Free trade eases the barriers to the exchange of goods and services to improve economic growth. These barriers are usually described as tariffs, quotas, and subsidies.

The costs and benefits of free trade are discussed below.

## Benefits of Free trade

-   Removing trade restrictions makes the domestic market accessible to foreign goods and creates competition among manufacturers, resulting in lower prices and more choices for consumers. A competitive market also nurtures innovation as businesses strive to stand out.
-   This model allows regions to focus on producing cost-effective goods that make the best use of their resources (comparative advantage). It liberates economies from inefficient businesses and outsources them to nations that handle them more efficiently. This cuts down manufacturing costs, reducing retail prices.
-   Additionally, the elimination of subsidies allows governments to allocate resources on other necessary projects.
-   Under free trade, countries with comparatively cheap labor or resources attract foreign investors. Foreign direct investments (FDI) have been pivotal in the growth of developing economies like South Africa and Mexico.
-   From a sustainability perspective, implementing strict environmental regulations, providing access and/or giving preference to environment-friendly technologies and green products can lead to a decline in pollution.

However, not all consequences of free trade policies are beneficial.

## Costs of Free Trade

-   Free trade policies can negatively impact certain industries and producers, leading to job losses as businesses expand overseas. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) signed between Canada, Mexico and the United States was instrumental in Mexico's industrial growth. While cheap labor prompted manufacturers/businesses to transfer production to Mexico, the American textile industry shrank with manufacturers declaring bankruptcy, closing down plants, and laying off workers.
-   Environmental and social regulations in developing countries are often more lax. The developed member nation(s) could shift manufacturing processes to avoid strict implementation of regulations. The Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provision allows investors to sue host governments if any governmental policy has impacted their profits. Such provisions allow multinational corporations to evade social, environmental and health policies. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) have garnered widespread criticism for not addressing these concerns adequately.
-   Furthermore, complete outsourcing and dependence on other regions for certain goods leave countries vulnerable to disruptions in the supply chain. The Pandemic and subsequent lockdowns have demonstrated the risks of over-reliance on imports.

The reality of free trade is, however, far more complex. The term free trade agreement is quite misleading for it leads one to assume that there is free movement of goods between the nations party to the agreement. FTAs are not limited to tariffs, quotas, and subsidies. In fact, nations have to comply with numerous, often stringent, requirements for their exports to qualify for preferential access to markets.

## The Global Shift towards Free Trade

### Introduction of GATT and MFA

Following the events of the Second World War, as a step towards reviving international trade, the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) was conceived. GATT was a multilateral agreement that sought to regulate international trade by lowering tariffs. The industrialized nations in GATT introduced the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA) in 1974, a quota system to protect their textile industries while simultaneously promoting the development of emerging nations. The quota system ensured that only a limited quantity of an industrializing nation's exports could access the markets of the Global North.

### Formation of WTO

At the Uruguay Round of Negotiations (1994), GATT members formed the World Trade Organization (WTO) to liberalize global trade. In contrast to GATT, WTO is an organization that oversees trade in goods, services, and intellectual property, promotes free trade among states, organizes trade negotiations, and settles trade disputes between governments. Under the WTO, the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing was introduced as a countermeasure to the MFA and aimed to phase out quotas by 2005.

### The Rise of NTMs

The fading quota system steadily traded places with alternative trade policies, called non-tariff measures (NTMs), which continue to proliferate owing to flexibilities in WTO guidelines. Much like a double-edged sword, NTMs are policy measures, other than tariffs, that can improve or impede trade. While tariffs have a clear purpose, NTMs can be more ambiguous in their impact on trade.

### Impact of NTMs

Certain NTMs are essential for sustainable development as they ensure the health and well-being of humans, animals, or plants as well as environmental protection. They form the basis of social and environmental sustainability policies and are instrumental in achieving Sustainable Development Goals. On the flip side, NTMs are notorious for inflating costs and creating impediments to trade flow and economic development. The charges associated with NTMs accumulate along the supply chain ultimately raising the retail price, offsetting any potential gains that reduced tariffs or quotas provide. NTMs can create unfair and discriminatory trade barriers for developing nations, restricting their ability to compete on a global scale and hampering their economic growth, due to:

-   Limited trade-related infrastructure, lack of advanced technology for production, or inadequate export services to meet NTM requirements. Often the products subject to NTMs are those where developing countries hold a comparative advantage. Moreover, different importing nations may require certification, and testing from their agency/institution of preference, contributing to procedural delays, additional fees, etc.
-   Developing countries often lack the resources necessary to understand and evaluate the consequences of NTMs applied to their exports. Frequent changes in NTMs can create further complications.

A number of NTMS are applied in the textile and apparel industry (Table 1).

For instance, the Rules of Origin (RoO) under NAFTA, require raw materials to originate from member nations despite the availability of cheaper alternatives, creating total dependence on those nations.
While the policies outlined under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement also demand locally produced textiles/raw materials for privileged market access, it presents a vast opportunity to spur production and exports (from raw materials to finished products) in African nations, promoting the growth of the local textile and apparel industries and decreasing their reliance on used garments and imported textiles.

## Conclusion

Policymakers and stakeholders involved in drafting trade policies for potential FTAs should prioritize clear communication and transparency throughout the process. As nations continue to pursue social and environmental sustainability, it is crucial that policies are designed to accommodate the needs of developing nations. This is necessary to preserve the true essence of free trade where sustainability is harmonized with economic growth and development. Implementation of these measures will assist in building a more equitable and prosperous global trading system.

## FAQs

**What is the difference between Liberalism (free trade) and Protectionism?**

Free trade aims to promote economic growth by lowering barriers to trade. Protectionism, on the other hand, seeks to protect the domestic market and promote local products by creating barriers for foreign goods in the form of tariffs and quotas or by providing incentives to domestic goods.

**What are tariffs, quotas, and subsidies?**

-   Tariffs are charges applied on foreign goods making them more expensive as compared to local products. Tariffs have to be paid by the importing nations consumers.
-   Quotas are restrictions on the quantity of an exported product levied by the importing nation.
-   Subsidies are financial incentives offered by governments to support or boost local businesses.

**Are Non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and Non-tariff measures (NTMs) the same?**

NTMs comprise of all trade policies, apart from tariffs, that impact the exchange of goods whether they hinder trade flow or improve it. While NTBs are a subset of these measures that adversely impact/affect trade.

**What is the AfCFTA?**

The African Continental Free Traded Area is the largest free trade area in the world. As of March 2023, 54 members of the African Union have joined AfCFTA. This agreement aims to remove trade barriers and allow intra-African trade to flourish. AfCFTA has the ability to drive industrialization, create employment opportunities and attract foreign investment, positioning Africa as a strong competitor in the global market.
